## How to contribute to Vatom

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching in the specific project on GitHub under [Issues].

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

* Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of the project will generally not be accepted.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change on [Vatom Feedback](https://feedback.vatom.com/) and start writing code.

* Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question about how to use Vatom products and projects in the [Vatom Suuport Site](https://support.vatom.com).

Thanks!
